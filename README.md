## üñ•Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js (v18+ recommended)
2. Supabase account with an active project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/swe-tickets.git
   cd swe-tickets
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
   ```

4. Set up your Supabase project:
   - Create a `tickets` table with the following schema:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE tickets (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       body TEXT NOT NULL,
       priority VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

## üîß Development Notes

1. **Refresh Tickets**: After creating or deleting a ticket, the dashboard automatically refreshes using Next.js's `router.refresh()`.
2. **Authentication**: Supabase manages user authentication and session cookies (`sb-access-token`).
3. **Error Handling**: API routes handle errors gracefully and log any issues in the console for debugging.

- Implement sorting and filtering options for tickets.
- Add real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions.
